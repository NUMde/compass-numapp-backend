= NUM-App Mobile Back End

https://github.com/NUMde/compass-numapp[Main Repository] | link:./docs[Back End Documentation]

== Welcome

This repository provides the source code for the mobile back end of the link:https://github.com/NUMde/compass-numapp[Compass NUM-App Project]. This project provides a set of open source components meant for the digital conduct of questionnaire based studies. The mobile back end itself is a  part of link:https://num-compass.science/[COMPASS] (**C**oordination **O**n **M**obile **P**andemic **A**pps best practice and **S**olution **S**haring).

The mobile back end provides study data for the NUM-App in form of link:https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html[FHIR Questionnaires]. It also stores the study data that is uploaded from the mobile app.
Additionally it makes the collected data accessible for other parties.

You can find an exemplary questionnaire https://github.com/NUMde/compass-implementation-guide/blob/master/input/questionnaire-generic.json[here]. 

== Development

=== Local Setup

* Make sure you have a recent version (LTS recommended) of
https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] installed and run the following commands to
download and prepare this repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/NUMde/compass-numapp-backend.git
npm install
----

* In case you use VSCode as your editor, install the recommended extensions

=== Run the back end locally

==== Create .env file
Some configuration values need to be present as environment variables during runtime.
The application loads a file  with the name `.env` during startup, if it is present.

To get started copy the file `.env.sample` to `.env` and add your values.

=== Generating RSA key pair

For local development we need an RSA key pair for the encryption with the client.
Execute the following commands to create a key pair.
The resulting files are picked automatically. But they can also be inserted into the `.env` file.

[source,bash]
----
$ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
$ openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
----

==== Generating certificate

To submit the public key to the client, a certificate must be created.
To create a self-signed certificate, which will be valid for 1 year, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ openssl req -x509 -days 365 -new -out self-signed-certificate.pem -key private_key.pem
----

The certificate must be put in the .env file. If no certificate is provided, the native app will default to a built-in
one (defined in src/config/appConfig.js).


=== Scripts

====  npm run start

Start the built application

====  npm run dev

Start the application on the local machine in watch mode. This is the preferred command for local development.

====  npm run build

Build the application into the `build` folder.

====  npm run clean

Clean the `dist` folder.

====  npm run lint

Lint the source code.

====  npm run prettier-format

Have prettier format your code.

====  npm run test

Run your unit tests with jest.

=== Environment variables used by the application

There are many different environment variables used by the application.
Most of them have default values, that can be overridden by exposing a different value as environment variable.
All used variables can be found in the `src/config` folder.

=== Committing code changes

This app uses https://typicode.github.io/husky[Husky] to trigger some actions during a commit.
Before each commit passes automatic tests and linting is run. If any action fails, the commit fails.

== Deployment

The application should run in any environment that provides a Node.js runtime.
The current configuration is suited for an OpenShift deployment. Find detailed instructions here link:./ocp_deployment[OCP Deployment].

== Database Setup

Dedicated documentation for the database setup can be found here link:./db[DB Setup].
